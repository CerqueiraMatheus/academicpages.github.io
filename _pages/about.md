Hey! My full name is **Matheus Henrique de Cerqueira Pinto**, but you may refer to me as **Matheus Cerqueira** or just Matheus. Currently, I'm a Computer Science undergraduate at University of Sao Paulo, located in Sao Carlos, Brazil.

I'm passionate about computers since I was a kid. There were lot of times that my parents got upset because I broke the OS of our shared PC. But well...

Some years later, especifically in 2016, I officialy started to study computers. I became a Computer Technician at IFPR, in Jacarezinho, my hometown. During the four years that I spent there, I learnt and taught robotics, developed websites and apps and almost reached Harvard.

Then, following my passion, I decided to continue my *learning path* studying Computer Science. Despite all problems that COVID-19 brought to our world (and mainly to Brazil), in 2020, I started to study in the biggest Latin America university, **University of Sao Paulo**.

Since then, I've been studying several themes, since Data Structures, Mobile Development and Operational Systems to Data Science and Machine Learning applied to cancer cases prediction.
